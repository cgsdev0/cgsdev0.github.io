Synchronizing physics across an online multiplayer game is a non-trival challenge. Generally, it requires running the simulation on an authoritative game server and sending updates to the clients. I tried this approach at first, but I felt I was adding a lot of bloat to my otherwise lightweight server.
I found surprisingly little information for how people approached this particular problem in the past, so I wanted to write this blog post to document my solution in case it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to anyone else.</description></item><item><title>New Personal Site</title><link>https://sarah.engineer/posts/test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 20:39:01 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://sarah.engineer/posts/test/</guid><description>I decided to finally build a new website, using Hugo.
I have this tendency to fall down absurd rabbitholes while working on projects like this. In this case, it involved making the home page of my website contain a (very rough draft of a) POSIX-like shell. Check it out if you&amp;rsquo;re a nerd like me! Just press &amp;lsquo;enter&amp;rsquo; on the main page to activate it.
How it&amp;rsquo;s Built The crux of this shell is bash-parser, a repository I stumbled across on GitHub.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://sarah.engineer/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sarah.engineer/about/</guid><description>Sarah Schulte is a software engineer with 5 years industry experience and an indie game developer.
